ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheNeonReaver

I am a computer engineering technologist and software programmer with a passion for computer science and creating interesting products. 
My interests include some of the most commonly-used programming languages in the modern day, including C, C#, C++, Java, and Python. 
I am also familiar with several web-development architectures such as HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL databases.
